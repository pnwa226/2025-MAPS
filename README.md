# Change of Downtown Space

## 2017 - 2021 Digital Elevation Comparison on Depot Street - Winchester, Kentucky

_This map uses LiDAR Point-Cloud Data in QGIS in order to vidualize the elevation changes in the area of interest. Comparisons were made looking at different temporal resolution selections of aerial photography, 3D visualization of Point-CLoud, and Elevation Profile._

# The Summit at Fritz Farm Surface Change

## From 2010 - 2019

_In this map, two phases of the area of interest was retrieved from kyfromabove. By combining the NAIP, Digital Surface Model, Digital Elevation Model, and Point Cloud Data, a comparison between Phase 1 (2010) and Phase 2 (2019) can be visualized_

# Tree Canopy Elevation

## University of Kentucky

_To make this map, kyfromabove 2018 NAIP and 2018 LiDAR Point Cloud. By identifying vegitation as >0.05 and subtracting this from the Digital Elevation Model, trees were extracted, and then catagoried by hieght into five catagories ranging from 15-300ft. This analysis was then used to compare tree height with field observations. I created a georeferenced image that could allow the map to be accessed on a moble device, therfore allowing tree geolocation and height comparison during the field observation. Note: Looking back at this catagorization, I would have chosen a more apporopriate height range._
